=head1 NAME

WWW::Wikipedia::LangTitles - get interwiki links from Wikipedia.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% example('synopsis') %]

=head1 VERSION

This documents version [% info.version %] of
WWW::Wikipedia::LangTitles corresponding to L<git commit [%
commit.commit %]|[% info.repo %]/commit/[% commit.commit %]> released
on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module retrieves the Wikipedia interwiki link titles from
wikidata.org. It can be used, for example, to translate a term in
English into other languages, or to get near equivalents.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 get_wiki_titles

   my $ref = get_wiki_titles ('Helium');

Returns a hash reference with all the articles in each language,
indexed by the language. For example C<< $ref->{th} >> will be equal
to ฮีเลียม, the Thai title of the equivalent Wikipedia article.

The language of the original page can be specified like this:

   use utf8;
   my $from_th = get_wiki_titles ('ฮีเลียม', lang => 'th');

The URL is encoded using L<URI::Escape/uri_escape_utf8>, so you must
use character strings not byte strings (use "use utf8;" etc.)

An option "verbose" switches on verbose messages with any true value:

   my $ref = get_wiki_titles ($name, verbose => 1);

The contents of these messages is not specified, and is liable to
change without notice in future releases.

As of this version, this deletes the non-Wikipedia sites like
Wikiquote and Wikiversity from the list of returned values

=head2 make_wiki_url

    my $url = make_wiki_url ('helium');

Make a URL for the Wikidata page. You will then need to retrieve the
page and parse the JSON yourself. Use a second argument to specify the
language of the page:

[% example('thai-url') %]

If no language is specified, the default is C<en> for English.

=head1 EXPORTS

Nothing is exported by default. The export tag ':all' exports all the
functions of the module.

    use WWW::Wikipedia::LangTitles ':all';

=head1 TESTING

The default tests of the module do not attempt to connect to the
internet.  To test using an internet connection, run F<xt/scrape.t>
like this:

    prove -I lib xt/scrape.t

from the top directory of the distribution.

=head1 HISTORY

This module was a collection of small scripts I had been using to
scrape multilingual article names related to physics from Wikipedia. I
made the scripts into a CPAN module because I thought it could be
useful to other people. Specifically, I used my scripts to add some
Japanese element names to L<Chemistry::Elements>, and I thought this
method might be useful for someone else.

Version 0.02 added the L</make_wiki_url> for people who want to
retrieve and parse the output themselves.
